Sunday upper body (combine this workout with the squats and deadlifts from Saturdays workout. Start with those first since you missed those)

Warmup with all stretches

Flat barbell bench 2ct pause Build up to a top set of 3 reps that is 4 from failure, then do 4x5 (4 sets of 5 reps) backoff sets -12% from the top set weight. My guess is your top set will be somewhere between 105-115lbs based on how you're feeling tomorrow
Incline dumbbell chest supported row 30lbs 2x8-12 3 from failure on each

Incline dumbbell bench 25lbs each arm 3x8-10 3 from failure on each
Dumbbell row 2ct pause at top 35lbs 2x8-10 3 from failure on each

Seated lateral raises 10lbs 3x9
Dumbbell skull crushers 12lbs 3x12-15 1-2 from failure on each (last set with left arm only since it's weaker)
