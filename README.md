# Weights

This project is something I coded for myself. It takes texts I get from my personal trainer and formats them in a useful manner. The goal of this project is to automate simple calculations (e.g. how much weight do I need to load onto an Olympic lifting bar which weights around 45 lbs. in order to life 100 lbs.?). I'm also going to try to implement a GUI to display the data with QT.

Since this is a personal project, I didn't focus on making an extremely robust parsing routine. It works enough to get the job done though.
