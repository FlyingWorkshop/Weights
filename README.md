# Weights

This is a personal project that parses texts I get from my personal trainer using a Python parser. The parser caches the parsed
data as a JSON which is then read in C++ and displayed with Qt.

Since this is a personal project, I didn't focus on making a universally robust parsing routine. The routine works and is robust for texts from my personal trainer, but it probably doesn't work on other inputs. I have provided some sample workout texts for testing, but I'm not releasing my full dev set since I don't want to publically release my workouts.
